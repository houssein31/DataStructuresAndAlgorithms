You are given a list of integers (both positive and negative). Find the continuous sequence of integers with the
largest sum

Write an algorithm to find the largest sum of the continuous sequence from the given list.

Input
The first line of input consists of an integer - inputArray_size, representing the size of the list (N).
The next line consists of N space-separated integers representing the elements of the list.

Output
Print an integer representing the largest sum of the continuous sequence from the given list.

Example
Input:
        6
        2-8 3 -2 4 -10
Output:
        5

Explanation:
The given list is (2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10), and we take (3, -2, 4) as the continuous sequence for getting the largest sum,
The sum is 3+ (-2) +4, which is 5.
So, the output is 5,
